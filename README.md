Find the [live project here](https://iarobinson.github.io/theEarthObject):

# [The Earth Object](https://iarobinson.github.io/theEarthObject/)

The goal here is to make a single object that encompasses everything on earth. I'm confident the project will evolve as time goes on. It could turn into a game, a useful object for modeling global data or something unimaginable at this point.

This is a brand new repo. I'm hoping that this will be a useful exercise for early stage programmers.

## So..why waiting?

If you need help on learning to contribute, I _think_ [this video](https://youtu.be/CL43zp0jlpc) describes the process. [This repo also looks like a great resource for early stage programmers](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
